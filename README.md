# Basic Usage

## Endpoints

> /regular/<playername>

> /ironman/<playername>

> /hardcore/<playername>

### Notes

This was originally intended as a wrapper for the RS API that allows for better formatted data returned. I'm not continually working on it and there are no endpoints for Group IronMan.
